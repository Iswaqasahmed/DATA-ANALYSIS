## Problem Statement:

  Rossaman is one of the larges drugstore chains in Germany, with operations across Europe. As of 2018, they have well over 3900 stores in Europe with an annual turnover of
9 Billion euros. *Our task is to predict the sales for a few identified stores on a given day*.

  Now, let's look at the problem form a ure busniess perspective. The first question you would need to ask is: Who is the end stakeholder for the business
problem and how is he going to utilize the solution? Well, given that this was an online data science competition, we won't have a validate answer for this question,
but we can more or less  figure out what one would look like.
  First, we need to reframe the problem statement in a slightly strategic way to be able to represent the problem statement as a design solution.
There are several problem-solving frameworks recognized by the market to  be more effective in solving teh problem. McKinsey's *"Situation-Complication-Question" (SCQ)* 
and Mu Sigma Inc.s *"Situation Complication Question"* (SCQ) are among the most popular frameworks. We will leverage one of the aforementioned frameworks to represent our
problem statement in a more effective and conscise way. But let us first understand why this would be important.
